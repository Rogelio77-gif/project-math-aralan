            <h3>PISA Preparation</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 7-8, 2024</p>
            <p>The Division of Romblon has developed an Action Plan in response to directives from the DepEd Central Office regarding PISA preparation. One key activity involves capacity-building for teachers of Science, Mathematics, and English in crafting PISA-type questions for use as review materials. 

<p>On November 7-8, 2024, teachers from these subject areas participated in a capacity-building workshop focused on creating PISA-type questions using technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI). The workshop was held at two venues: Magdiwang National High School and Looc National High School. At Magdiwang NHS, attendees included department heads or subject coordinators from Magdiwang NHS, Danao NHS, and Cajidiocan NHS. In Looc NHS, participants represented Looc NHS, Esteban Madrona NHS, Guinbirayan NHS, Agripino Armedilla NHS, San Andres Cultural HS, Odiongan NHS, and Mayha NHS.<p>

<p>The half-day workshops at each venue followed a structured format. The opening program included a message from the CID chief, followed by a discussion of the activity's rationale. Participants were then presented with the Division's PISA preparation action plan and instructed to develop their own action plans.<p>

<p>The core of the workshop focused on capacity-building in crafting PISA-type questions using AI. After an overview of various AI tools, participants engaged in hands-on activities, creating PISA-type questions and parallel questions to existing PISA questions using their preferred AI tools. The workshop also addressed data interpretation using AI. Participants analyzed their PISA Science pretest results, using the data to inform intervention activities.<p> 

<p>The concluding session, led by CID Chief Melchor M. Famorcan, focused on ways forward. Agreements were reached on several key actions, including conducting pretests for English and Mathematics, organizing a PISA Day, integrating PISA-type questions into weekly lessons, preparing action plans, and monitoring PSDSs.<p>

<p>The activity concluded with the presentation of certificates of participation to all attendees.
